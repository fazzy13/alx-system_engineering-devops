# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions
This repository contains exercises and examples for working with shell variables and expansions, as well as init files for the shell.

## Learning Objectives
By completing the exercises in this repository, you will learn:

* How to set and use shell variables
* How to use expansion to manipulate shell variables and output
* How to use shell init files to configure your shell environment

## Repo Structure
The repository is organized into directories for each exercise, as well as a tests directory for testing your solutions. Each exercise directory contains a README file with a description of the exercise and a list of tasks to complete, as well as one or more shell scripts to modify and execute.

## The exercises are organized as follows:

* `0-alias`: Script to create an `alias` named `ls` with value rm `*.`
* `1-hello_you`: Script to print `hello USER`, where `USER` is the current Linux user.
* `2-path`: Script to add `/action` to the end of the `PATH` environment variable.
* `3-paths`: Script to count the number of directories in the `PATH` environment variable.
* `4-global_variables`: Script to list environment variables.
* `5-local_variables`: Script to list all local variables and environment variables, and functions.
* `6-create_local_variable`: Script to create a new local variable named `BETTY` with value `Holberton`.
* `7-create_global_variable`: Script to create a new global variable named `HOLBERTON` with value `Betty`.
* `8-true_knowledge`: Script to print the result of the addition of `128` with the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`.
* `9-divide_and_rule`: Script to print the result of the division of `98` by the environment variable `DIVIDE_ME`.
* `10-love_exponent_breath`: Script to display the result of `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE`.
* `11-binary_to_decimal`: Script to convert a number in `base 2` to `base 10`.
* `12-combinations`: Script to print all possible combinations of two letters, except `oo`.
* `13-print_float`: Script to print a number with two decimal places.
* `14-decimal_to_hexadecimal`: Script to convert a number in `base 10` to `base 16`.
* `100-rot13`: Script to encode and decode text using the `rot13` encryption.

## Getting Started
